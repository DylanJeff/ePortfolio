				<h2>Why Computer Science?</h2> <!-- Subtitle -->
				<p>
					Hello there! My name is Dylan Jeffries and I am studying Computer Science at Manchester Metropolitan University.
					At the time of creating this ePortfolio I am 18 years old, having lived in Manchester for all 18 of those years.
					I chose to study Computer Science because ever since Year 7, when I was first introduced to basic video games coding, 
					I have wanted to do something in the software development field. In secondary school, maths was my best subject, 
					leading to programming being a skill that I picked up really quickly. Mixing my ability to do well in programming and 
					my enthusiasm towards it outside the classroom has become an obvious choice for me, hence why I'm here.
				</p>
				
				<h2>My interests</h2>
				<p>
						Other than Computer Science, I have some interests that are relatable to CS but also a few that don't exactly
					come together naturally. I'm very much interested in technology, especially when it comes to space and futurism, 
					among further interests like gaming, airplanes, religion and politics. One example of perhaps an unusual aspect about 
					me would be my fascination with listening to and playing music from the late 50's and early 60's, managing to teach 
					myself the piano and the guitar.
