				<h1>Self Assessment</h2> <!-- Title -->
				
				<h2>Problem Solving</h2> <!-- Subtitle -->
				
					<p>
							Out of all the attributes I'd probably say this one is my strongest. I've always been quite good at Maths, and mixing that with learning
							Python in Secondary School really helped me realise I was quite good at finding solutions and putting them into code. Theres 100% a certain
							pleasure to being presented with a problem and finding the best solution, I think that enjoyment of finding solutions has been the main driver
							for me.
					</p>
					
				<h2>Professionalism and Communication</h2>
				
					<p>
							I've never had an issue with people when dealing with them professionally and my communication is also good. When fixing things for neighbours, I've
							always been able to simplify their problem and get it sorted out. I particulary enjoy helping those who may be a bit "old" for some pieces of tech.
							I understand there are certain rules and procedures that have to be carried out when dealing with professional issues and how important they are to being successful.
					</p>
					
				<h2>Teamwork and Leadership</h2>
				
					<p>
							Leadership is probably my weakness here as I like to sit back and listen mostly, which may be due to a lack of confidence earlier on in education.
							Though this is the case, I have no issues whatsoever when it comes to working in a team. I never like to feel as if I'm a liability and always put in the effort
							to help where I'm best needed.
