				<p>
					In Web Design and Development (WDD) I have learned how to create a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.	
				</p>
				<p>
					What I enjoy about WDD:
					<ol>
						<li>Lots of code</li>
						<li>Get to build something from the ground up</li>
						<li>Brand new skills learned in CSS</li>
						<li>Learn techniques and practises that are used in professional work</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					My future in WDD will involve me learning about JavaScript integration and the uses of servers through
					PHP and MySQL.

				<p> <!-- Main text in the aside -->
					Web Design and Development is one of the modules I enjoy the most. Being a fan of coding, I feel it is a natural part of the course for me.
					I'm really liking it so far, by looking at whats left in the year I think this will continue. The module overall is taught really well, with challenging
					labs and lectures that actually keep you interested.

				<p>
					In Computer Systems Fundamentals (CSF) I have learned about how a Computer is a barebones logic machine built with miniscule components.	
				</p>
				<p>
					What I enjoy about CSF:
					<ol>
						<li>Put purpose to already known content</li>
						<li>Answered some questions I may have had before coming to University</li>
						<li>Working with logic</li>
						<li>Learning a decent bit of Maths aswell</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					My future in CSF will involve me learning more and more maths related to Computers. I'm not complaining, I like Maths.

				<p>
					Computer Systems Fundamentals has been the most interesting module for me so far, as it has introduced the most new things to me.
					I didn't really think I was intrigued as much when it come down to the depths of a computer, but I have found myself pleasantly shocked.
					The lectures are a highlight of this course for me as I think they are performed at a perfect pace, and are full of content for making
					good notes with. The labs are also a great credit with exercises that don't only reinforce your understanding but expand it.
