					In Programming I have learned the basics of coding with Java.	
				</p>
				<p>
					What I enjoy about Programming:
					<ol>
						<li>Coding</li>
						<li>Coding</li>
						<li>Coding</li>
						<li>A bit more coding</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					My future in Programming will involve me learning even more Java. Later in the year we'll go into a proper IDE so we can create
					deeper detailed programs.

					My opinion of Programming
				</h1>
				
				<p> <!-- Main text in the aside -->
					Programming is my favourite module simply because its the reason I do Computer Science. Programming is what got me interested in Computers
					in the first place and this module is definetly living up to my expectations. I'm already adept in Java but the freedom of the labs allows me
					to continue developing my knowledge with new resources. I'm finding it really fun.

			<article> <!-- IS -->
			
				<h1>Information Systems</h2> <!-- Subtitle -->
				
				<img src="Images/erd.png" alt="Image of an Entity Relationship Diagram">
				
				<p>
					In Information Systems (IS) I have learned about databases, the planning of them and their uses in business.
				</p>
				<p>
					What I enjoy about IS:
					<ol>
						<li>Insight into Computer Science in business</li>
						<li>Gives me more understanding of why CS is so important</li>
						<li>Probably the most useful in terms of post University skills</li>
						<li>Get to organise stuff</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					My future in IS will involve me continuing the assignment of designing and developing a database for a fictional small business.

			<aside> <!-- IS Aside -->
				
				<h1> <!-- Aside heading -->
					My opinion of IS
				</h1>
				
				<p>
					Information Systems is a balanced module for me. I do enjoy designing, creating and organising databases. Yet on the other hand it isn't my
					preferred activity. Databases and IS in general tends to be more focused on the business side of things, whereas I'm more technical. Of course I
					understand that in an ever digitalising world, databases are the core of everything worth something nowadays and that if theres anything you need to
					learn for employability purposes, its IS.
